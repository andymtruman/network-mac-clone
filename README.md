# network-mac-clone
A Quick and Easy way to scan your local network and clone a MAC address from another machine.


Network-mac-clone was written as my second ever python project, after 'Hello World'. It is my first attempt at creating python code,
so i appreciate any input.

To install, just download the .py and run it.

No version control currently.

The application explains itself, it asks you which network interface you want to use, what IP addresses/network you wish to scan, and
then you select a MAC address.

The application then resets the selected network adapter with the new MAC.

Only currently tested on one machine, still a work in progress.

ifconfig
nmap-python
netifaces

All three are required for the application to work.
